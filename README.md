# lab12

The methods of the LinkedLab12<E> class that you need to write are:
1. moveFirstToEnd | a method taking no parameters; it moves the rst element to the rear
of the list; throws NoSuchElementException if the list is empty
2. moveEndToFirst | a method taking no parameters; it moves the last element to the front
of the list; throws NoSuchElementException if the list is empty
3. swap | a method taking a pair of indices as parameters; it swaps the items at the two
indicated locations; throws IndexOutOfBoundsException if either of the indices is invalid
4. reverse | a method taking no parameters; it reverses the order of the elements in the list.
This reversal is done in place. This means that all the next elds are changed to point to the
previous element rather than the next element
